        <div class="description">
            <p>Located in Calgary, I offer both paid PC building for those in the area and free PC part picking consultation. 
                If you're wondering what parts to pick, just send over your budget and I can help! 
                If the cost of building is too much or too little for you, we can negotiate and come up with a price. 
                If you're not happy with the finished result, you can send it back to fix or we can come to an agreement (full or partial refund.)</p>

        <div class="description">
            <p>If you want a PC built for you, you can give me the already-purchased parts (preferred) or send the money for it to be purchased, 
                and I'll build it for you for a base price of $100. Either I come pick up the parts from you or you can drop the parts off here, and I'll get to work!
            I have no problem giving you my phone number if you want to stay in touch, and I'll make sure to keep you updated. If you're just looking for consultation on part selection
        or something of the likes, feel free to email me! You can find my email on the contact/about page.</p>

                <p>I'm 18 and I love building computers. I built my first computer back in July and I had a great time doing it (it also booted up with no problems!)
                    If you wish to contact me for a PC build or consultation, email me directly at raphc19@outlook.com! 
                    I look forward to doing business with you and appreciate your consideration!</p>
