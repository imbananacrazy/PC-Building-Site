            <p>Located in Calgary, I offer both paid PC building for those in the area and free PC part picking consultation. 
                If you're wondering what parts to pick, just send over your budget and I can help! 
                If you're wanting a PC to be built, you can give me the already-purchased parts (preferred) or send the money for it to be purchased, 
                and I'll build it for you for a base price of $100. If the cost of building is too much or too little for you, we can negotiate and come up with a price. 
                If you're not happy with the finished result, you can send it back to fix or we can come to an agreement (full or partial refund.)</p>
