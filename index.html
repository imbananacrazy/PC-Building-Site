        <div class="description">
            <p>Located in Calgary, I offer both paid PC building for those in the area and free PC part picking consultation. 
                If you're wondering what parts to pick, just send over your budget and I can help!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="title"><h1>How does it work?</h1></div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>If you want a PC built for you, you can give me the already-purchased parts (preferred) or send the money over for it to be purchased, 
                and I'll build it for you for a base price of $100. Either I come pick up the parts from you or you can drop them off to me, and I'll get to work!
            I have no problem giving you my phone number if you want to stay in touch, and I'll make sure to keep you updated.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="title"><h1>Why?</h1></div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Building a PC yourself or getting someone locally to do it is generally cheaper than buying a pre-built from a major
                corporation. Not to say that they're bad, but if you're willing to help out a local and up-and-coming business, feel free 
                to contact me! I'd love to help out people trying to save money on a new computer or someone trying to understand more about
                PC building. I'm 18 and I have a genuine passion for building computers. I built my first computer back in July with a friend and I had a great time doing it. 
                There's just something about putting all the pieces together and making it work that I love, and any excuse for me to work on computers is a good excuse in my book.

                <p>If you wish to contact me for a PC build or consultation, email me directly at <a class="contact-email-hyperlink" href="mailto:rlccomputerscontact@gmail.com">rlccomputerscontact@gmail.com</a>! Make sure to let me know
                    what you care about:
                    What's your budget? Do you care about looks? If so, what aesthetic are you aiming for? What do you plan to use the PC for? 
                    Do you prefer air-cooled or water-cooled (aio)? I'll make sure to ask any other questions
                    if there's any information missing so I can best understand what you're looking for.
                    I look forward to doing business with you and appreciate your consideration!</p>
